# VC Syntax

In order to efficiently describe verifiable credentials, we shall use the following simplified syntax.

The notation that we propose is as follows:

```js
{ Relation (entity1@, entity2+) } [signatory-]
```

using the normal shorthand expression, where:

- **Relation**: is the relation holding between one or more entities;
- **entity1@**: identifies an entity using an indirect expression, such as a URI;
- **entity2+**: identifies an entity using a direct public key reference;
- **signatory-**: identifies the private key of the entity acting as a signatory of the expression;

and `A -> B` is used to denote message passing, e.g.

```js
signatory -> entity2 : { Relation (entity1@, entity2+) } [signatory-]
```

At an implementation level, each statement is encapsulated as a [W3C Verifiable Credential (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

The schemas used are formally defined in the following section: xxx
